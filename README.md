A demo for a project I had created as a part of an Ethereum Blockchain Course.

The project is a campaign website (similar to kickstart) where you can ask for funds for your project and anyone can support you with ether.

I used Solidity Smart Contracts to control the flow of ether between the campaign owner and supporter and used React.js and Next.js to create a simple interactive frontend.
